To maximize the efficiency of caching in your GitHub Actions workflow, you can optimize the cache keys and include more directories/files for caching. Here's how you can improve the cache management in your GitHub Actions workflow:

Optimize Cache Keys:

Use more specific cache keys to distinguish between different cache states. For example, you can include the hash of the composer.lock file to invalidate the cache when dependencies change.
Consider including the hash of the package.json or yarn.lock file for Node.js dependencies.
Add a hash of the Dockerfile itself to invalidate the cache when the Dockerfile changes.
Cache More Directories/Files:

Include additional directories/files that are frequently accessed or modified during the build process.
Cache the Composer cache directory ($HOME/.composer/cache), Yarn cache directory ($HOME/.yarn/cache), and NPM cache directory ($HOME/.npm), if applicable.
Cache any other directories that contain large dependencies or artifacts used during the build process.
Use Cache Dependencies with Docker Build:

Instead of relying solely on Docker image layer caching, you can cache dependencies separately to speed up the build process.
For example, cache Composer dependencies, Yarn/npm dependencies, and any other dependencies before building the Docker image. Then, during the Docker build, you can copy these dependencies into the image, reducing the need to download them again.
Here's an updated version of your GitHub Actions workflow with improved cache management:
